# CustomInputManager Quick Start Guide

Welcome to CustomInputManager! This simple guide will get you started on a simple project, with several custom keybinds and a menu where your user can create their own configurations!

### Step One: Download

You can download the latest release [here](../../releases). Open the Unity package in your project, and follow the instructions in the popup dialog box to import the code in.

### Step Two: Configuration

Upon import, a folder named 'CustomInputManager' will be created. In order to add the Input Manager to your scene, add 'Scenes/InputManager.cs' into any object that will not be cloned or destroyed.
